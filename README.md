## About This Blog App

This blog uses NextJS and React for the frontend and is styled using TailwindCSS. All pages are statically generated (getStaticProps/getStaticPaths), but SSR/ISR could be used very easily if desired.

Content is managed with [SanityCMS](https://sanity.io). If you wish to use this project for your own blog, you will need to create an account with Sanity in order to get your own project ID.
